###Finder Help

* show recent folders

Folder list is the same as go->recent folders menu items. But you can select them rapidly and you can see the whole path.

* custom defined favorites list

There has some folder you always used but can not remember. Then you can record them in the paths.config file.

**in the FindHelp folder there has a file with name q_workflow.scpt, i copied from https://github.com/qlassiqa/qWorkflow. But it not support modifier subtext,I changed it.**
